Python Community Server
=======================
         --> alpha test v0.01

PyCS is still unstable.  It's suitable for running a web server on -
it's running http://rcs.myelin.cjb.net/ quite happily - but it will
require some hacking to get it to work on your system.


DEPENDENCIES

Medusa - http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/

- unpack this into the same dir as PyCS.


MetaKit - http://www.equi4.com/metakit/python.html

- install as usual.  Put Mk4py.so and metakit.py into your PyCS
dir if it doesn't work.


xmlrpclib - http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/

- as above


NOTES

To install, first edit pycs.conf and change the settings to ones that
make sense for you.  'serverhostname' should be your host, and
'serverport' should be the port you want to run on.  The server runs
on port 5445 by default - change this to 80 if you don't have another
server running on the same machine.

You can use mod_rewrite and mod_proxy in Apache if you like to make it
look like just another virtual host - put the following in your virtual
host block:

	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:5445/$1 [P]

You'll want to run it as an unprivileged user.  It will do this
automatically one day, but for the moment it just runs as whoever
started it.  Create another user, copy all the files into their home
dir, give them rwx to the www/ directory and rx to everytihng else,
and run as them.

It dumps its log to stdout at the moment; pipe that where you want
the log to go.  There's a logging framework built into Medusa, but
I haven't told it where to send things yet.

If anyone wants to fix anything or add features, feel free!  BUT:
join the mailing list and announce what you're about to do first,
so everyone else knows not to work on the same thing.

To join the list, mail pycs-request@myelin.co.nz and put 'subscribe
pycs' in the body of your message.
