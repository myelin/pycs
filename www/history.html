	<h1><a href="http://www.pycs.net" class="quietLink">PyCS</a>: Version 
	history</h1>
	
<div class="margins">
	
	<p>This is a summary of the major changes that have occurred between 
	versions of Python Community Server.</p>

	<p>Some of these releases are available from the <a 
	href="http://pycs.sourceforge.net/">project home page</a> at SourceForge 
	and source archives are available from the links below.  Code usually 
	goes into <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=51025">SF 
	CVS</a> around the same time as it is posted on this page, .</p>
	
	<p>The version number is fairly ordinary; it has a major and a minor 
	part.  So far it's not release quality, so the major number is zero. 
	The minor number of the initial release was 1 (making v0.01 the first 
	release) and this increments every time something interesting 
	happens.</p>
	
	<p>Here are the details:</p>
	
	<ul>

		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.07-src.tar.gz">v0.07</a></strong> -
		Added the option to log in (go to /system/login.py) and then 
		delete comments from your blog.  Delete buttons now appear in 
		comment windows if you are logged in. <br /><br />

		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.06-src.tar.gz">v0.06</a></strong> -
		added the option to put a limit (config key 'maxusernum') on the 
		number of users that are allowed on a server.  If you want to 
		have a private server that only hosts a single blog, register 
		your Radio with the server and then edit pycs.conf and set 
		maxusernum=0.  Now, PyCS will not auto-create accounts for 
		anybody else.<br /><br />
		
		Also got <a 
		href="http://rcs.userland.com/initialResources">initial 
		resources</a> going; you can, for example, put a 
		'defaultFeeds.opml' file in /var/lib/pycs/www/initialResources 
		and all your users will start off with the same feeds.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.05-src.tar.gz">v0.05</a></strong> -
		Fixed up 'make install' so it actually puts things where you 
		would expect them to go on a normal Unix system.  Also fixed 
		some silly comment bugs that totally broke the comment system 
		sometime since 0.04.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.04-src.tar.gz">v0.04</a></strong> -
		Comment system made more flexible by the addition of <b>comment 
		formatters</b> (see the <b>comments/</b> directory).  These 
		allow you to present comments in a number of different formats. 
		Currently HTML (default) and RSS (so you can subscribe to a 
		popular comment page and see new comments in a news aggregator) 
		are supported.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.03-src.tar.gz">v0.03</a></strong> -
		URL rewriting (see <b>pycs_rewrite_handler.py</b>) and virtual 
		hosting added.  This allows you to do more interesting things 
		with your URLs by passing incoming HTTP requests through 
		arbitrary regular expressions.  For example with this and a bit 
		of symlinking, you can make a copy of PyCS behave like Manila 
		and give each new user a subdomain.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.02-src.tar.gz">v0.02</a></strong> -
		Bug fixes etc.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.01-src.tar.gz">v0.01</a></strong> -
		Initial public release. </li>
	
	</ul>
