	<h1><a href="http://www.pycs.net" class="quietLink">PyCS</a>: Version 
	history</h1>
	
<div class="margins">
	
	<p>This is a summary of the major changes that have occurred between 
	versions of Python Community Server.</p>

	<p>Some of these releases are available from the <a 
	href="http://pycs.sourceforge.net/">project home page</a> at SourceForge 
	and source archives are available from the links below.  Code usually 
	goes into <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=51025">SF 
	CVS</a> around the same time as it is posted on this page, .</p>
	
	<p>The version number is fairly ordinary; it has a major and a minor 
	part.  So far PyCS is stable, but not perfect, so the major number is 
	zero. The minor number of the initial release was 1 (making v0.01 the 
	first release) and this increments every time something interesting 
	happens.</p>
	
	<p>Here are the details:</p>
	
	<ul>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.11-src.tar.gz">v0.11</a></strong> -
		Thanks to <a href="http://hugo.muensterland.org/">Georg 
		Bauer</a>, who contributed a counter script 
		(<b>/system/count.py</b>) and a referrer page script 
		(<b>/system/referers.py</b>), PyCS now does referrer tracking 
		the same way as <a href="http://rcs.userland.com/">RCS</a>. That 
		is to say, automatically ;-)<br/><br/>
		
		You can still use the old method (calling 
		<b>make_referrers.py</b> from a cron job) if you like, but this 
		one produces a less cluttered page, only counts real browser 
		hits, and looks more like the results you would see when running 
		on RCS.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.10-src.tar.gz">v0.10</a></strong> -
		Thanks to Michael Hay (Michael dot Hay at hds dot com; no blog 
		AFAIK), who contributed a script to go into init.d and hooked 
		PyCS up to daemonize.py, PyCS now runs as a proper 
		daemon.<br/><br/>
		
		Improved the installer to reduce the number of steps required to 
		get everything going.  Now you don't have to separately edit 
		pycs.conf and pycs_paths.py if installing in a nonstandard 
		location.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.09-src.tar.gz">v0.09</a></strong> -
		Added in support for basic HTTP authentication, using 'users.conf'
		to store passwords (same path as pycs.conf and rewrite.conf).
		Details of file format in authorizer.py.<br/><br/>

		Added in some prefix variables so you can install somewhere
		other than /.  Edit the Makefile and pycs_paths.py and you can
		install in a user dir and not need to be root to run 'make
		install'.<br/><br/>

		The time format for the weblog updates page 
		has been changed, meaning that updates show up in the right 
		order now and can be cleared after 24 hours.</li>

		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.08-src.tar.gz">v0.08</a></strong> -
		Various minor changes.  The updates page now shouldn't produce 
		multiple entries when a blog changes its name.  Style sheet 
		links back to www.myelin.co.nz; outage cleared.  Presentation 
		changes in analyse_logs.py.  Mailing list address changed. 
		xmlStorageSystem.getServerCapabilities() now returns a 
		webBugUrl, to make <a 
		href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/bzero/">bzero</a> happy.</li>

		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.07-src.tar.gz">v0.07</a></strong> -
		Added the option to log in (go to /system/login.py) and then 
		delete comments from your blog.  Delete buttons now appear in 
		comment windows if you are logged in.</li>

		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.06-src.tar.gz">v0.06</a></strong> -
		added the option to put a limit (config key 'maxusernum') on the 
		number of users that are allowed on a server.  If you want to 
		have a private server that only hosts a single blog, register 
		your Radio with the server and then edit pycs.conf and set 
		maxusernum=0.  Now, PyCS will not auto-create accounts for 
		anybody else.<br /><br />
		
		Also got <a 
		href="http://rcs.userland.com/initialResources">initial 
		resources</a> going; you can, for example, put a 
		'defaultFeeds.opml' file in /var/lib/pycs/www/initialResources 
		and all your users will start off with the same feeds.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.05-src.tar.gz">v0.05</a></strong> -
		Fixed up 'make install' so it actually puts things where you 
		would expect them to go on a normal Unix system.  Also fixed 
		some silly comment bugs that totally broke the comment system 
		sometime since 0.04.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.04-src.tar.gz">v0.04</a></strong> -
		Comment system made more flexible by the addition of <b>comment 
		formatters</b> (see the <b>comments/</b> directory).  These 
		allow you to present comments in a number of different formats. 
		Currently HTML (default) and RSS (so you can subscribe to a 
		popular comment page and see new comments in a news aggregator) 
		are supported.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.03-src.tar.gz">v0.03</a></strong> -
		URL rewriting (see <b>pycs_rewrite_handler.py</b>) and virtual 
		hosting added.  This allows you to do more interesting things 
		with your URLs by passing incoming HTTP requests through 
		arbitrary regular expressions.  For example with this and a bit 
		of symlinking, you can make a copy of PyCS behave like Manila 
		and give each new user a subdomain.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.02-src.tar.gz">v0.02</a></strong> -
		Bug fixes etc.</li>
	
		<li><strong><a href="pycs-0.01-src.tar.gz">v0.01</a></strong> -
		Initial public release. </li>
	
	</ul>
